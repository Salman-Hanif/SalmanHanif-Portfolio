üßæ Project Overview
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a web developer. The project has evolved over time as I progressed in my learning ‚Äî so the code reflects that journey.

‚öôÔ∏è Styling Methods (Important Note)
Disclaimer:
This project contains a mix of styling techniques including:

Vanilla CSS (external and internal styles)

SCSS (Sass preprocessor) for modular, cleaner code

Tailwind CSS for utility-first modern styling

Initially, when I started this project, I only knew basic CSS, so early sections of the code use plain external and inline CSS.
Later, I learned about SCSS, found it more manageable, and started applying it to newer parts.
Eventually, I moved on to Tailwind CSS, which I now prefer and used for the final redesigns.

Due to this transitional development process, the codebase might appear inconsistent or a bit hard to follow in terms of styling structure ‚Äî but it's a reflection of my learning progress. I plan to refactor the whole design in the future using only Tailwind for consistency.
